# Visual design guidance

Adapted from the bundled Impeccable 3.5.0 skill (Apache 2.0). Read the sections relevant to the visual decision being made; these are design defaults, not a new project brief. The user's choices and the repository's DESIGN.md take precedence. Reuse established tokens, typefaces, icons, and dependencies. Do not add an effect, library, palette, or motion solely to satisfy a generic style preference.

Contents: color, typography, layout, motion, interaction, copy, new visual identities, patterns to avoid, and distinctiveness checks.

For contrast, the large-text threshold uses points, not CSS pixels: 18pt regular or 14pt bold. See [WCAG 2.1 contrast guidance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

## Color

- **Verify contrast.** Body text must hit ≥4.5:1 against its background; large text (≥18pt or bold ≥14pt) needs ≥3:1. Placeholder text needs the same 4.5:1, not the muted-gray default. The most common failure: muted gray body text on a tinted near-white. If the contrast is even close, bump the body color toward the ink end of the ramp; light gray "for elegance" is the single biggest reason AI designs feel hard to read.
- Gray text on a colored background looks washed out. Use a darker shade of the background's own hue, or a transparency of the text color.

## Typography

- Cap body line length at 65–75ch.
- Hierarchy through scale + weight contrast (≥1.25 ratio between steps). Avoid flat scales.
- Cap font-family count at 3 (display + body + optional mono). More than 3 reads as indecision, not richness. One well-tuned family with weight contrast usually beats three competing typefaces.
- Don't pair fonts that are similar but not identical (two geometric sans-serifs, two humanist sans-serifs). Pair on a contrast axis (serif + sans, geometric + humanist) or use one family in multiple weights.
- No all-caps body copy. Reserve uppercase for short labels (≤4 words), section eyebrows (used sparingly per the Patterns to avoid), and badges. Sentences in ALL CAPS are unreadable at body sizes.
- Hero / display heading ceiling: clamp() max ≤ 6rem (~96px). Above that the page is shouting, not designing.
- Display heading letter-spacing floor: ≥ -0.04em. Anything tighter and letters touch; cramped, not "designed".
- Use `text-wrap: balance` on h1–h3 for even line lengths; `text-wrap: pretty` on long prose to reduce orphans.

## Layout

- Vary spacing for rhythm.
- Cards are the lazy answer. Use them only when they're truly the best affordance. Nested cards are always wrong.
- Flexbox for 1D, Grid for 2D. Don't default to Grid when `flex-wrap` would be simpler.
- For responsive grids without breakpoints: `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(280px, 1fr))`.
- Build a semantic z-index scale (dropdown → sticky → modal-backdrop → modal → toast → tooltip). Never arbitrary values like 999 or 9999.

## Motion
- Motion should be intentional, and not be an afterthought. consider it as part of the build.
- Don't animate CSS layout properties unless truly needed.
- Ease out with exponential curves (ease-out-quart / quint / expo). No bounce, no elastic.
- Use libraries for more advanced motion needs (e.g. motion, gsap, anime.js, lenis etc)
- Reduced motion is not optional. Every animation needs a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` alternative: typically a crossfade or instant transition.
- Staggering the items within one list is legitimate. The tell is the uniform reflex (one identical entrance applied to every section), not motion itself; each reveal should fit what it reveals. Suppressing the reflex is never a reason to ship a page with no motion at all.
- Reveal animations must enhance an already-visible default. Don't gate content visibility on a class-triggered transition; transitions pause on hidden tabs and headless renderers, so the reveal never fires and the section ships blank.
- Premium motion materials are not just transform/opacity. Blur, backdrop-filter, clip-path, mask, and shadow/glow are part of the palette when they materially improve the effect and stay smooth.

## Interaction

- Dropdowns rendered with `position: absolute` inside an `overflow: hidden` or `overflow: auto` container will be clipped. Use the native `<dialog>` / popover API, `position: fixed`, or a portal to escape the stacking context.

## Copy

- Every word earns its place. No restated headings, no intros that repeat the title.
- **No em dashes.** Use commas, colons, semicolons, periods, or parentheses. Also not `--`.
- **No aphoristic-cadence body copy as a default voice.** Don't fall into the rhythm of "serious statement, then punchy short negation" as the page's recurring voice. If three or more section copy blocks on the page land on a short rebuttal-shaped sentence, rewrite. Specific, not aphoristic.
- **No marketing buzzwords.** The streamline / empower / supercharge / leverage / unleash / transform / seamless / world-class / enterprise-grade / next-generation / cutting-edge / game-changer / mission-critical family of phrases. Pick a specific noun and a verb that describes what the product literally does.
- Button labels: verb + object. "Save changes" beats "OK"; "Delete project" beats "Yes". The label should say what will happen.
- Link text needs standalone meaning. "View pricing plans" beats "Click here"; screen readers announce links out of context.

## New projects only (when no prior work exists)

## Color & Theme

- Use OKLCH.
- **The cream / sand / beige body bg is the saturated AI default of 2026.** The whole warm-neutral band (OKLCH L 0.84-0.97, C < 0.06, hue 40-100) reads as cream/sand/paper/parchment regardless of what you call it. Token names like `--paper`, `--cream`, `--sand`, `--bone`, `--flour`, `--linen`, `--parchment`, `--wheat`, `--biscuit`, `--ivory` are tells in themselves. If the brief is "warm, traditional, family-coastal-Italian" or "magazine-warm" or "editorial-restraint", DO NOT translate that into a near-white warm-tinted bg; that's the AI move. Pick: (a) a saturated brand color as the body (terracotta, oxblood, deep ochre, near-black), (b) a true off-white at chroma 0 (or chroma toward the brand's own hue, not toward warmth-by-default), or (c) a darker mid-tone tinted neutral that's clearly the brand's own. "Warmth" in the brand is carried by accent + typography + imagery, not by body bg.
- Tinted neutrals: add 0.005–0.015 chroma toward the brand's hue. Don't default-tint toward warm or cool "because the brand feels that way"; that's the cross-project monoculture move.
- When picking a theme: Dark vs. light is never a default. Not dark "because tools look cool dark." Not light "to be safe.".Before choosing, write one sentence of physical scene: who uses this, where, under what ambient light, in what mood. If the sentence doesn't force the answer, it's not concrete enough. Add detail until it does.
- Pick a **color strategy** before picking colors. Four steps on the commitment axis:
  - **Restrained**: tinted neutrals + one accent ≤10%. Product default; brand minimalism.
  - **Committed**: one saturated color carries 30–60% of the surface. Brand default for identity-driven pages.
  - **Full palette**: 3–4 named roles, each used deliberately. Brand campaigns; product data viz.
  - **Drenched**: the surface IS the color. Brand heroes, campaign pages.

## Patterns to avoid

Check these patterns against the brief and existing design contract; use a different structure when they add decoration without meaning.

- **Side-stripe borders.** `border-left` or `border-right` greater than 1px as a colored accent on cards, list items, callouts, or alerts. Never intentional. Rewrite with full borders, background tints, leading numbers/icons, or nothing.
- **Gradient text.** `background-clip: text` combined with a gradient background. Decorative, never meaningful. Use a single solid color. Emphasis via weight or size.
- **Glassmorphism as default.** Blurs and glass cards used decoratively. Rare and purposeful, or nothing.
- **The hero-metric template.** Big number, small label, supporting stats, gradient accent. SaaS cliché.
- **Identical card grids.** Same-sized cards with icon + heading + text, repeated endlessly.
- **Tiny uppercase tracked eyebrow above every section.** The 2023-era kicker (small all-caps text with wide tracking, "ABOUT" "PROCESS" "PRICING" above each heading) is now the saturated AI scaffold; repeating it regardless of the brief makes pages feel interchangeable. One named kicker as a deliberate brand system is voice; an eyebrow on every section is AI grammar. Choose a different cadence.
- **Numbered section markers as default scaffolding (01 / 02 / 03).** Putting `01 · About / 02 · Process / 03 · Pricing` above every section is the eyebrow trope one tier deeper: reach for it because "landing pages do this" and you're scaffolding by reflex. Numbers earn their place when the section actually IS a sequence (a real 3-step process, an ordered flow, a typed timeline) and the order carries information the reader needs. One deliberate numbered sequence on one page is voice; numbered eyebrows on every section across the site is AI grammar.
- **Text that overflows its container.** Long heading words plus large clamp scales plus narrow grids cause headline overflow on tablet/mobile. Test the heading copy at every breakpoint; if it overflows, reduce the clamp max or rewrite the copy. The viewport is part of the design.

## The AI slop test

If someone could look at this interface and say "AI made that" without doubt, it's failed. Cross-register failures are the patterns below above. Register-specific failures live in each reference.

**Category-reflex check.** Run at two altitudes; the second one catches what the first one misses.

- **First-order:** if someone could guess the theme + palette from the category alone, it's the first training-data reflex. Rework the scene sentence and color strategy until the answer isn't obvious from the domain.
- **Second-order:** if someone could guess the aesthetic family from category-plus-anti-references ("AI workflow tool that's not SaaS-cream → editorial-typographic", "fintech that's not navy-and-gold → terminal-native dark mode"), it's the trap one tier deeper. The first reflex was avoided; the second wasn't. Rework until both answers are not obvious. The brand register's [reflex-reject aesthetic lanes](brand.md) list catches the currently-saturated families.
